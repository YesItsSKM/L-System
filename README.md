# L-System

GUI based L-System implementation takes the core concepts of L-Systems and the tools and power of Unity 3D game engine to demonstrate how L-Systems work and making it easier to comprehend and understand the underlying process of procedural content generation which is widely used in the field of computer graphics such as computer games, Visual Effects (VFX), procedural modeling as well as random (well, stochastic) content generation and so on.

A simple but effective software (that can be deployed on the web and desktop) that uses Unity Engineâ€™s technology to implement and display L-Systems and can be modified using a handy GUI.
This method and software can be used to simulate and produce branching tree structures using L-Systems.
